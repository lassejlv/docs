## What is Prismo?

Prismo is an open-source package that makes it fun to work with your [Turso Database](https://turso.tech) with a simple and prisma-like-style-syntax. That uses Turso's REST API to interact with the database.

#### Example

```ts
const guild = await db.findFirst<Guild>({
  table: "Guild",
  where: {
    id: "1234567",
  },
});
```

## Why use Prismo?

Prismo comes with full type-safety, auto-completion, and is just a fun way to interact with your database. It's also a great way to get started with Turso.
